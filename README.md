# AR_Image_Capture
This is an augmented reality coloring application built in Unity engine and coded with OpenCV and Vuforia plugins.
The aim of this project is that users can paint coloring pages and apply their creations to extended content, such as an animated 3D model, for example.  
The system can capture image targets from any angle with the device camera and extract their content to project them into a square image, so it can be used as a UV map to texture any 3D model.  
In order to use AR Image Capture it is required to import both the OpenCV implementation for Unity and Vuforia engine first.  
AR Image Capture project was made with Unity 2022.3.12f1 version.
